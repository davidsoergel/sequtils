/**
 * Interface for objects that are able to provide a list of the "first words" associated with a sequence spectrum.  The
 * purpose of this is that we may compute a chain of spectra, e.g., computing conditional k-mer probabilities from
 * absolute probabilities, which are in turn based on counts.  A spectrum based on conditional probabilities does not
 * fully describe the distribution unless the starting points are also specified.  A spectrum may be based on multiple
 * independent sequences (either becaue there are multiple inputs, or because there are unknown symbols in the
 * sequence).  Thus, a complete specification of the spectrum requires a list containing the initial word of each
 * segment.  This list can be propagated around, or not, depending on whether it is relevant, independent of the rest of
 * the model (e.g., the conditional probabilities).
